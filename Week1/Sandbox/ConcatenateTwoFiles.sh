#$1 is the way the shell script defines a placeholder for a variable eg the filename 
# assigned $1 as line number 
#the direction of the mouth is the final product 
#Â eg 1 < 2, 2 is the result

#arguments are placed into the termianal after the file name.
#bash script.sh file1.txt file2.txt merged.txt -> this is what it should look like
